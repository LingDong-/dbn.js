// Overview:	

// First, a simple background is	
// created, consisting of 3 lines	
// on a gray backdrop. These lines	
// imply the corner of some room.	
// What room could this be? It	
// could be any room of course.	
// To say that it is *this* room	
// over *that* room would surely	
// be unjust. Thus, assume it	
// stands for the representation	
// of *any* room, for now.

// Second, a chair is rendered in	
// order to establish the three-	
// dimensional space better. Of	
// course more chairs and other	
// obiects would help to concep-	
// tually cement the depicted space.	

// Alas, I am too far beyond the due	
// date for this book and must	
// suffer the fate of an empty room	
// for now.	

// Third, recognizing that the room	
// does indeed look too visually	
// impoverished to leave this	
// example comfortably, I stare	
// at my tabletop and the mouse	
// looks back at me ... longing	
// to belong to the scenery. And	
// thus a small dab of virtual	
// ink gives it that dose of hope.
